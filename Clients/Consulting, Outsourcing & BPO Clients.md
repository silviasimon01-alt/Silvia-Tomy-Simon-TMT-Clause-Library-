## Redline Risk Heatmap — Clause Risk Summary

| Clause | Risk Level | Key Sensitivities | Drafting Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Data protection & DPA | 🔴 High | Breach-notification windows, cross-border transfers | Ensure DPA aligns with GDPR/DPDP; clarify subprocessors and breach handling SLAs. |
| Subcontractor & offshore delivery | 🔴 High | Data residency, transfer restrictions, control over sub-processors | Require explicit approvals for offshore loci, flow-downs and audit rights. |
| Business continuity & step-in | 🔴 High | Operational continuity & customer impact | Define clear triggers, costs and notice periods for step-in. |
| IP ownership & OSS | 🟠 Medium | Ownership clarity and OSS contamination risk | Require OSS inventory and warranty/indemnity for IP infringement. |
| Anti-bribery & sanctions | 🟠 Medium | Reputational and regulatory risk | Include representations, training and audit rights. |
| Limitation of liability | 🟠 Medium | Adequacy of cap vs service criticality | Adjust caps based on revenue, criticality and industry norms. |
| Non-solicit clauses | 🟢 Low | Enforceability dependent on reasonableness | Keep durations reasonable (6–24 months) and geographic scope narrow. |
| Fees, tax indemnities | 🟢 Low | Allocation of tax risks | Specify tax gross-up or indemnity where appropriate. |

## Drafting Recommendations & Practical Controls

**Must-have (High Risk):**
- Robust DPA with subprocessors, international transfer mechanisms (SCCs / equivalent), DPIA obligations and breach-notice SLAs.
- Subcontractor registry and prior written consent for offshore service delivery involving personal data or critical systems.
- Clear step-in rights, run-book for transition, and tested DR/BC plans with RTO/RPO targets.
- IP assignment mechanics for bespoke deliverables and OSS disclosure schedule with remediation rights.

**Recommended (Medium Risk):**
- Escalation / Governance model (Steering Committee) with weekly/monthly cadences and dispute escalation paths.
- Insurance minimums (PI, cyber) with named insured clauses where required.
- Audit windows and security certification requirements (SOC2/ISO27001) with remediation SLAs.

**Standard (Low Risk):**
- Standard SLAs with service credits, termination thresholds for repeated SLA breaches and a reasonable change-management process.

## Final Note (Operational & Legal Integration Guidance)

1. **Make Data & Subcontractor controls contractual priorities.** For BPOs and offshore delivery ensure DPAs and subprocessors are contractually aligned to statutory obligations.  
2. **Condition Precedents:** Require evidence of insurances, security certs and licences before go-live.  
3. **Test exit & step-in plans early.** Run simulated transitions to validate practical readiness and data portability.  
4. **Governance cadence matters.** Embed weekly operational calls + monthly steering to resolve issues early and document decisions.  
5. **Price / Tax clarity.** Define whether fees are inclusive/exclusive of taxes, and allocate withholding/collection responsibilities.  
6. **Localise per jurisdiction.** Employment law, data residency and regulatory reporting vary—include exhibits per jurisdiction where services are delivered or data is processed.  
7. **Risk sizing & caps.** Align liability caps with the criticality of services and potential downstream losses — higher for critical infrastructure / customer-facing operations.
