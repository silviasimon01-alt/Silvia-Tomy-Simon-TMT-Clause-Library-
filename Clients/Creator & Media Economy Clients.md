- Pre-approved music, fonts, visuals under cleared license or royalty-free use.  

**Recommended (Medium Risk):**  
- Revenue-share reporting template; audit rights; quarterly analytics review.  
- DPA execution for influencer databases and consumer data.  
- Short, reasonable exclusivity terms to avoid restraint issues.  

**Standard (Low Risk):**  
- Force majeure & termination reversion clauses.  
- Standard non-solicit, confidentiality, and arbitration clauses.

## Final Note (Operational & Legal Integration Guidance)  

1. **Define ownership early.** Brands should ensure clear IP assignment post-payment; creators must preserve pre-existing rights.  
2. **Mandatory disclosures = zero-tolerance risk.** FTC/ASCI/DSA enforcement risk is rising; integrate compliance pre-posting.  
3. **Preserve creator voice while assigning IP.** Retain moral rights consent structure, not blanket waiver.  
4. **Enable transparent monetisation.** Require verified analytics sharing for influencer campaigns and shared IP licensing.  
5. **Data flow transparency.** Ensure all viewer analytics collection complies with GDPR/DPDP, including opt-outs.  
6. **Termination and reversion readiness.** Upon early exit, confirm who retains IP and live content status on platforms.  
7. **Govern contractual hygiene.** Keep all deliverables logged, approvals documented, and communications archived for regulatory defence.
