- Include separate DPA with granular subprocessors / subprocessor register (Article 28 GDPR; DPDP processor flow-down). :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}  
- For EU clients or any cross-border users, align documentation with the EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems: risk assessments, technical documentation, and registries. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}  
- Keep model/hyperparameter escrow triggers objective and narrow to avoid commercial friction while protecting continuity.
