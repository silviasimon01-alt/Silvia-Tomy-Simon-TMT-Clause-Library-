## Drafting Recommendations & Practical Controls  

**Must-have (High Risk):**  
- Execute **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** with detailed HIPAA/GDPR/DPDP alignment.  
- Obtain and maintain **ISO 13485** and **ISO 27001** certifications.  
- Include **regulatory classification statement** in Schedule A.  
- Maintain **audit-ready documentation** (validation, PMS, CAPA).  

**Recommended (Medium Risk):**  
- Include **Cybersecurity Annex** (encryption, patching, vulnerability testing).  
- Link **recall procedures** to indemnity and insurance clauses.  
- Create **Consent Template & Workflow** for patients/users.  

**Standard (Low Risk):**  
- Standard dispute resolution, force majeure, and termination clauses.

## Final Note (Operational & Legal Integration Guidance)  

1. **Classification drives everything.** Establish medical device / wellness / CDS classification early to define obligations.  
2. **Data ≠ normal personal data.** Health data triggers strict consent, breach reporting, and encryption duties.  
3. **Compliance is ongoing.** Post-market surveillance, CAPA, and clinical updates must be continuous.  
4. **Interoperability = liability.** Ensure data exchange standards (FHIR, HL7) are secure and authenticated.  
5. **Cybersecurity is clinical safety.** Software failures or vulnerabilities can constitute patient harm.  
6. **Regulatory readiness.** Maintain all records for 10 years (EU MDR standard) or as mandated locally.  
7. **Embed compliance into tech.** Use “privacy by design” and “safety by design” principles across code, APIs, and updates.
