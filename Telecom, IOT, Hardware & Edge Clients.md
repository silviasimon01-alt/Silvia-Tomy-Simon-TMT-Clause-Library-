## Drafting Recommendations & Practical Controls

**Must-have (High Risk):**
- Condition precedent for licences, type-approvals and certification before shipment/activation.
- Signed firmware & SBOM delivery; authenticated OTA update process with test restores.
- Export-control classification (ECCN) and encryption compliance schedule; deny supply to sanctioned parties.
- Detailed recall & safety incident procedure with regulatory notification timelines.

**Recommended (Medium Risk):**
- Source-code escrow for critical embedded systems with clear release triggers.
- Supplier flow-down clauses with audit rights and mandatory security clauses for OEM/ODM.
- Defined EOL & spare-part commitments, with minimum support windows for critical deployments.

**Standard (Low Risk):**
- SLAs with MTTR, monitoring telemetry access and escalation matrix.
- Routine certification renewals, annual pen-tests and ISO/TL9000 evidence.

## Final Note (Operational & Legal Integration Guidance)

1. **Make regulatory clearances a gating item.** For telecom and radio-enabled IoT the vendor’s authorisations are precondition to deployment and commercial acceptance.  
2. **Prioritise secure firmware lifecycle and SBOM.** Supply-chain compromise is the leading systemic risk for hardware/edge deployments — insist on signed firmware, SBOM and authenticated OTA.  
3. **Export controls and sanctions cannot be delegated away.** Even inadvertent transfer of controlled crypto-enabled hardware can trigger severe penalties — require classification and export licences.  
4. **Plan for lawful-interception and privacy tensions.** Draft clear playbooks balancing lawful access, retention obligations and privacy/DPA constraints; allocate costs and notice rules.  
5. **Design EOL and support obligations explicitly.** Hardware is long-lived — specify spare parts windows and migration assistance to reduce stranded-asset risk.  
6. **Insurance & indemnity alignment.** Ensure product liability, cyber and recall i
