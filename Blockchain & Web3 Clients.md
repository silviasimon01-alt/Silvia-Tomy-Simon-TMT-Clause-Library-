## Redline Risk Heatmap — Clause Risk Summary  

| Clause | Risk Level | Key Sensitivities | Drafting Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Token Issuance & Classification | 🔴 High | Misclassification = securities violation | Obtain legal opinion + disclosure schedule. |
| Data Protection (Blockchain) | 🔴 High | Conflict with erasure rights | Use off-chain storage + hash references. |
| AML/KYC Compliance | 🔴 High | FATF & PMLA enforcement | Implement automated Travel Rule compliance. |
| DAO Governance | 🟠 Medium | Legal personhood uncertainty | Wrap DAO under entity (LLC / Foundation). |
| Smart Contract Audit | 🟠 Medium | Code vulnerabilities | Include mandatory third-party audit. |
| NFT Licensing | 🟢 Low | Standard IP assignment | Clarify ownership vs. license scope. |
| Custody & Key Management | 🟢 Low | Operational | Implement HSM, multi-sig, incident reporting. |

---

## Drafting Recommendations & Practical Controls  

**Must-have (High Risk):**  
- **Token Legal Opinion** (classification + disclosure per MiCA/SEC).  
- **Smart Contract Audit Certificate** before deployment.  
- **AML/KYC Policy** consistent with FATF & national AML directives.  
- **DPA for On-Chain Data** covering anonymization/encryption obligations.  

**Recommended (Medium Risk):**  
- DAO governance wrapper (Wyoming DAO LLC, Swiss Verein, or Cayman Foundation).  
- Automated incident & key recovery procedure.  
- NFT resale royalty automation verification.  

**Standard (Low Risk):**  
- Standard limitation, indemnity, and arbitration clauses.  
- Force majeure clauses covering forks, 51% attacks, or regulatory bans.

## Final Note (Operational & Legal Integration Guidance)  

1. **Token = security risk until proven otherwise.** Conduct a legal test (Howey, MiCA, VDA) before any public sale.  
2. **Privacy ≠ immutability.** Store personal data off-chain, hash references on-chain for compliance.  
3. **Audit before deploy.** Smart contract audits are now a regulatory expectation, not optional.  
4. **DAO ≠ legal vacuum.** Always use a wrapper entity to manage treasury and liability.  
5. **Travel Rule is global.** Crypto transfers ≥ threshold must include KYC metadata.  
6. **IP ≠ NFT.** NFTs only transfer token ownership; IP licensing must be in writing.  
7. **Incident readiness = credibility.** Maintain proof of cybersecurity resilience and recovery processes.
