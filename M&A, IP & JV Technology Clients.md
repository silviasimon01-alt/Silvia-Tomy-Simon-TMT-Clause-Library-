**🟠 Medium Risk — Qualify / Condition**  
- Add *DTAA gross-up*, *OSS audit report*, *TTBER reference*, *export-control carve-out*.  
- Insert *knowledge qualifiers* for IP warranties.  

**🟢 Low Risk — Standard Boilerplate**  
- Maintain current drafting. Ensure procedural filings (recordations, escrows, renewals).
