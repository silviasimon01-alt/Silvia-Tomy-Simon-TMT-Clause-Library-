## Drafting & enforcement recommendations (short)
- Ensure **assignment instruments** are executed as present transfers (“hereby assigns”), recorded in registries where necessary (TM/Patent); attach proof in Annex A.  
- For **non-compete**, prefer **sale-of-business** context + narrow geography/duration; where risky, use **non-solicit** + confidentiality.  
- For **OSS**, require a signed OSS Disclosure Schedule and an independent code-scan report (attach as Annex B).  
- For **post-closing deliverables**, include explicit timelines (30/90 days), recordation obligations and escrow mechanics.
